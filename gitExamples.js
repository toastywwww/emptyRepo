// git init - makes a new repo, ONLY DO ONCE FOR EACH PROJECT!
// git commit - saves mini, changes while coding. Helpful incase you break something and cannot fix it. It's like going back to a fresh start.
// THIS IS THE LAST COMMENT

//Git Push origin HEAD - this will push your local code to the remote repo
//git checkout - this is how you swithc between branches (add -b if its a branch that does not exist yet)
